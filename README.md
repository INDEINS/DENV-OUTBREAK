# DENV_OUTBREAK 
**Genomic surveillance for Dengue peruvian outbreaks**

## Introduction  
**Genomic epidemiology** help to undestand the populations dinamics changes that occur in pathogens related to new outbreaks of **dengue virus**. 
A recent outbreak of Dengue has been emerged since probably since dicember of 2012 to actually in **peruvian population**. 
Is important detect, study, report and share the genomic information for **public health decission**    

## Scope
**INDE lab from INS detected a lack knowledge realed to lineage reports** for dengue virus. In sense, 
this github **has been created to permit difussing, discuss and propossed more strengh genomic surveillance of dengue** with the scientific community. Because
